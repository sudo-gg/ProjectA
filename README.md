# ProjectA
Project done for qualification (Not for actual use...)
This is why there are extremely unnessesary backend features made exclusively to flex i suppose.
Also missing several important features of a booking system which I am aware of, but I got full marks on it and knew I could stop since it wouldnt 
show any other skills and I was (very) busy at the time
